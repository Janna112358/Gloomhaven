# Gloomhaven
Pointless Gloomhaven optimization for nerds. Gloomhaven is a board game by Isaac Childres (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven).

## Contents
```Gloomhaven.py```:
Functions to compute the maximum number of turns you have left to play, given cards in hand and cards in discard. Also functions to compute the number of turns lost by preventing damage (losing a card in hard or two from discard).

```turns_plots.py```:
Makes nice plots of results from functions in '''Gloomhaven.py'''. Simply run with:
```bash
python3 turns_plots.py
```
Not tested on python2 but could very well work.
